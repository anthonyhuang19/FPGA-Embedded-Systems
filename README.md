# Digital-Logic-and-Computer-Organization
This course provides an introduction to the design and implementation of digital circuits and microprocessors. Topics include transistor network design, Boolean algebra, combinational circuits, sequential circuits, finite state machine design, processor pipelines, and memory hierarchy. Design methodology using both discrete components and hardware description languages is covered in the laboratory portion of the course.  Outcome 1: Understand Boolean logic and state machines as theoretical foundations of digital systems.  Outcome 2: Be able to conceive, analyze, design, and build combinational and sequential digital logic solutions to everyday problems.  Outcome 3: Comprehend the basic structure and functionality of ROM and RAM memories.  Outcome 4: Understand the basic structure and functionality of central processing units, and build a simple one using FPGA hardware.  Outcome 5: Understand the structure and operation of memory hierarchies and input/output systems.
